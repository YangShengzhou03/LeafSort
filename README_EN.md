## 📋 Project Introduction

LeafView is a powerful image management tool focused on efficiently managing, intelligently organizing, and batch processing various image files.

### ✨ Core Features

- **Efficient Image Management**: Supports multiple image formats, quick browsing and management of large numbers of images
- **Intelligent Organization**: Automatically classify and organize images by time, location, device, and other dimensions
- **Duplicate Detection**: Intelligently identify similar images based on perceptual hash algorithms
- **EXIF Editing**: View and modify image metadata information
- **OCR Text Recognition**: Extract text content from images
- **Batch Processing**: Supports batch renaming, format conversion, applying filters, and other operations

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11+
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 6.5.0+
- **Image Processing**: Pillow 11.3.0+
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR 5.3.0+
- **Metadata Processing**: piexif, exiftool
- **Other Dependencies**: numpy, scikit-image, opencv-python

### Architecture Design

LeafView adopts a three-tier architecture design to ensure code maintainability and scalability:

1. **User Interface Layer**: Modern GUI interface built on PyQt6
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Handles core business logic and feature implementation
3. **Data Processing Layer**: Responsible for file operations, metadata processing, and database interactions

- Tesseract OCR (for text recognition functionality)

### Source Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YangShengzhou03/LeafView.git
   cd LeafView
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```bash
   python App.py
   ```

### Pre-compiled Version

You can download pre-compiled executable files for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/YangShengzhou03/LeafView/releases) page.

### Packaging as Executable

```bash
# Windows
pyinstaller -w -F --icon=resources/img/icon.ico App.py
```

## 💡 User Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Import Images**: Import images through the "File" menu or by dragging and dropping
2. **Browse Images**: Use mouse wheel, arrow keys, or thumbnail list to browse
3. **View Details**: Click the "Details" button to view image metadata
4. **Batch Processing**: Select multiple images and use the right-click menu for batch operations

### Intelligent Organization

The intelligent organization feature supports the following classification methods:

- **By Time**: Year/Month/Day hierarchical structure
- **By Location**: Automatic classification based on GPS information
- **By Device**: Classification by camera model, phone brand
- **By Type**: Classification by image format or content type
- **Custom Rules**: Supports custom organization rules based on regular expressions

Operation steps:
1. Select the images you want to organize
2. Click the "Intelligent Organization" button
3. Choose the organization method and target location
4. Click "Start Organization" to execute the operation

### Duplicate Detection

1. Select the folder or image set you want to deduplicate
2. Click the "Find Duplicates" button
3. Set the similarity threshold (0-100%)
4. View duplicate results and choose to keep or delete

### EXIF Editing

1. Select the image you want to edit
2. Click the "Edit EXIF" button
3. Modify the metadata you want to update (such as title, author, rating, etc.)
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes

### Text Recognition

### Performance Optimization

- **Cache Mechanism**: Thumbnail and metadata caching
- **Batch Processing**: Process large image collections in batches
- **Concurrent Processing**: Use multi-threading to optimize IO-intensive tasks

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module Import Error**
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`

2. **HEIC/HEIF Format Support**
   - Install pillow-heif library: `pip install pillow-heif --upgrade`

3. **OCR Function Cannot Be Used**
   - Ensure Tesseract OCR is correctly installed and added to system PATH

4. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce cache size or process images in batches
