## 💡 User Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Import Images**: Import images through the "File" menu or by dragging and dropping
2. **Browse Images**: Use mouse wheel, arrow keys, or thumbnail list to browse
3. **View Details**: Click the "Details" button to view image metadata
4. **Batch Processing**: Select multiple images and use the right-click menu for batch operations

### Intelligent Organization

The intelligent organization feature supports the following classification methods:

- **By Time**: Year/Month/Day hierarchical structure
- **By Location**: Automatic classification based on GPS information
- **By Device**: Classification by camera model, phone brand
- **By Type**: Classification by image format or content type
- **Custom Rules**: Supports custom organization rules based on regular expressions

Operation steps:
1. Select the images you want to organize
2. Click the "Intelligent Organization" button
3. Choose the organization method and target location
4. Click "Start Organization" to execute the operation

### Duplicate Detection

1. Select the folder or image set you want to deduplicate
2. Click the "Find Duplicates" button

4. Wait for recognition to complete, view or copy the recognition results

## 🔌 Plugin System

LeafView provides a flexible plugin system that supports custom feature extensions.

### Plugin Development

Plugins need to inherit from the `LeafViewPlugin` base class and implement the necessary interfaces:

```python
class MyPlugin(LeafViewPlugin):
    def __init__(self, main_window):
        super().__init__(main_window)
        self.plugin_name = "My Plugin"
        self.plugin_version = "1.0.0"
        self.plugin_description = "Plugin description"
        self.plugin_author = "Author"
    
    def initialize(self):
        super().initialize()
        # Plugin initialization logic
    
    def get_menu_items(self):
        return [
            ("Plugin Menu", "Menu Item", self.on_menu_clicked)
        ]
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### Custom Organization Rules

Support for custom organization rules based on regular expressions, EXIF metadata, and GPS locations:

```python
# Example: Date-based organization rule
class DateArrangeRule(BaseArrangeRule):
    def match(self, file_info):
        return 'DateTimeOriginal' in file_info.get('exif', {})
    
    def get_target_path(self, file_info, base_dir):
        date_str = file_info['exif']['DateTimeOriginal'].split()[0].replace(':', '/')
        return os.path.join(base_dir, date_str, os.path.basename(file_info['path']))
```

### Cloud Storage Integration

Supports integration with cloud storage services such as AWS S3, Alibaba Cloud OSS, etc., for convenient image backup and synchronization.

### Performance Optimization

- **Cache Mechanism**: Thumbnail and metadata caching
- **Batch Processing**: Process large image collections in batches
- **Concurrent Processing**: Use multi-threading to optimize IO-intensive tasks

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module Import Error**
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`

2. **HEIC/HEIF Format Support**
   - Install pillow-heif library: `pip install pillow-heif --upgrade`

3. **OCR Function Cannot Be Used**
   - Ensure Tesseract OCR is correctly installed and added to system PATH

4. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce cache size or process images in batches

### Error Code Reference

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|----------|------|----------|
| ERR-001 | File does not exist or cannot be accessed | Check file path and permissions |
| ERR-002 | Unsupported file format | Install the corresponding decoder library |
| ERR-003 | Insufficient memory | Reduce processing batch or increase memory |
| ERR-004 | Insufficient disk space | Clean up disk space |
| ERR-005 | Network connection failure | Check network settings |
| ERR-006 | Permission denied | Run with administrator privileges |
| ERR-007 | Missing dependency libraries | Reinstall dependency libraries |
| ERR-008 | Configuration file corrupted | Delete configuration file and regenerate |
